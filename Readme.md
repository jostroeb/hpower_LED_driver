This is a university project, where we developed a high power LED System with focus on the electric properties.
It featueres a USB-PD power supply, 40W RGBW LED and a ESP32 for control.

It is the equally shared work of me and my colleague Simon Follmann.
I was mainly involved in circuit design and simulation of the LED driver, USB-PD power supply and layouting of the PCB. 

This is a university-only project, Carl Zeiss AG is not invovled commercially in any means. They are mentioned, as they were the sponsor of my studies in the system of co-op studying at DHBW.
